# Errand List Coding Challenge

Hello and thank you for the opportunity to work and showcase my coding skills to you! This challenge was both exciting and challenging for me! One of the biggest challenges for me was nesting list items. This was a new concept for me but I was fortunately able to push through and learn how to do it.  :relieved:
